IF WE WANT to override the default varibale (Alreday defined existed variable) while creating the resource we can use terraform apply -var="variable_name=value"

exammple:-
terraform apply -var="s3_bucket_name=my-unique-bucket-name-12345"
This will override the default value of variable s3_bucket_name while creating the resource.
This method is useful when we want to create multiple resources with different variable values without changing the variable definition file.
This method is also useful when we want to keep sensitive information like passwords or API keys out of our configuration files.
Note: Make sure the variable name used in the command matches the variable name defined in the variable definition file.
For example, if we have a variable defined as follows in our variables.tf file:
variable "s3_bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket"
  type        = string
  default     = "my-default-bucket-name"
}
We can override the default value by using the following command:
terraform apply -var="s3_bucket_name=my-unique-bucket-name-12345"
This will create an S3 bucket with the name "my-unique-bucket-name-12345" instead of the default name "my-default-bucket-name".
Make sure to run terraform plan first to see the changes that will be made before applying them.
